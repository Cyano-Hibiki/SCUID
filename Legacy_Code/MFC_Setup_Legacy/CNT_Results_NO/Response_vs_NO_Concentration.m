% This script reads the sensor data from Chip 5 taken on 6/16/2022.
% It makes a plot of Response versus NO concentration.
% The plot was done on the data from Pads 7-12.

%% Finding Delta R and Concentration 
% The code below finds the change of response over 1 minute after each
% addition of NO into the system. There are in total seven additions, with
% incremental concentration values. These seven additions happens between
% roughly 2 and 3.75 hours after the start of data collection.

% Manually found indices corresponding to starting points of NO additions.
% This should be automated once figured out smoothing algorithm.
